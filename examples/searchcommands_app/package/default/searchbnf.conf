alias =
shortdesc = Counts the number of non-overlapping matches to a regular expression in a search result.
description = A count of the number of non-overlapping matches to the regular expression specified by pattern is \
    computed for each record processed. The result is stored in the field specified by fieldname. If fieldname exists, \
    its value is replaced. If fieldname does not exist, it is created. Results are otherwise passed through to the \
    next pipeline processor unmodified.
comment1 = Count the number of words in the text of each tweet in the tweets lookup table and put the result in \
    word_count.

alias =
shortdesc = Computes the sum of a set of fields.
description = The total produced is sum(sum(fieldname, 1, n), 1, N) where n = number of fields, N = number of records.
comment1 = This example computes the total linecount in the first 200 records in the _internal index.

shortdesc = Counts the number of non-overlapping matches to a regular \
    expression in a search result.
description = A count of the number of non-overlapping matches to the regular \
    expression specified by pattern is computed for each record processed.
    The result is stored in the field specified by fieldname. If fieldname \
    exists, its value is replaced. If fieldname does not exist, it is \
    created. Results are otherwise passed through to the next pipeline \
    processor unmodified.
comment1 = Count the number of words in the text of each tweet in tweets.csv \
    and put the result in word_count.

    in the _internal index.

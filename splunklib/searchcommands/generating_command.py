class GeneratingCommand(SearchCommand):
    """ Generates events based on command arguments.

    Generating commands receive no input and must be the first command on a pipeline. By default Splunk will run your
    command locally on a search head. By default generating commands run in the streams pipeline.

    .. code-block:: python

        @Configuration()
        class StreamingGeneratingCommand(GeneratingCommand)
            ...

    You can change the pipeline that a generating command runs in using the :code:`type` configuration setting. For
    example, to run your command in the eventing pipeline, configure your command like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        @Configuration(type=`eventing`)
        class EventingGeneratingCommand(GeneratingCommand)
            ...

        @Configuration(type=`reporting`)
        class ReportingGeneratingCommand(GeneratingCommand)
            ...

    You can tell Splunk to run your streaming generating command in a distributed manner on a search head, or remotely
    on indexers:

    .. code-block:: python

        @Configuration(distributed=True)
        class SomeGeneratingCommand(GeneratingCommand)
            ...

    Only streaming generating commands may be distributed.

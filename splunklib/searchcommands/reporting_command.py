class ReportingCommand(SearchCommand):
    """ Processes search results and generates a reporting data structure.

    Reporting search commands run as either reduce or map/reduce operations. The
    reduce part runs on a search head and is responsible for processing a single
    chunk of search results to produce the command's reporting data structure.
    The map part is called a streaming preop. It feeds the reduce part with
    partial results and by default runs on the search head and/or one or more
    indexers.

    You must implement a :meth:`reduce` method as a generator function that
    iterates over a set of event records and yields a reporting data structure.
    You may implement a :meth:`map` method as a generator function that iterates
    over a set of event records and yields :class:`dict` or :class:`list(dict)`
    instances.

    **ReportingCommand configuration**

    Configure the :meth:`map` operation using a Configuration decorator on your
    :meth:`map` method. Configure it like you would a :class:`StreamingCommand`.

    Configure the :meth:`reduce` operation using a Configuration decorator on
    your :meth:`ReportingCommand` class.

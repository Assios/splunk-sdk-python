class StreamingCommand(SearchCommand):
    """ Applies a transformation to search results as they travel through the processing pipeline.

    Streaming commands typically filter, sort, modify, or combine search
    results. Splunk will send search results in batches of up to 50,000 records.
    Hence, a search command must be prepared to be invoked many times during the
    course of pipeline processing. Each invocation should produce a set of
    results independently usable by downstream processors.

    By default Splunk may choose to run a streaming command locally on a search
    head and/or remotely on one or more indexers concurrently. The size and
    frequency of the search result batches sent to the command will vary based
    on scheduling considerations. Streaming commands are typically invoked many
    times during the course of pipeline processing.

    You can tell Splunk to run your streaming command locally on a search head,
    never remotely on indexers.

    .. code-block:: python

        @Configuration(local=False)
        class SomeStreamingCommand(StreamingCommand):
            ...

    If your streaming command modifies the time order of event records you must
    tell Splunk to ensure correct behavior.

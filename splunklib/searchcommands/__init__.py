    """ Instantiates and executes a search command class

    This function implements a `conditional script stanza <http://goo.gl/OFaox6>`_ based on the value of
    :code:`module_name`::

        if module_name is None or module_name == '__main__':
            # execute command

    Call this function at module scope with :code:`module_name=__name__`, if you would like your module to act as either
    a reusable module or a standalone program. Otherwise, if you wish this function to unconditionally instantiate and
    execute :code:`command_class`, pass :const:`None` as the value of :code:`module_name`.

    :param command_class: Class to instantiate and execute.
    :type command_class: :code:`SearchCommand`
    :param argv: List of arguments to the command.
    :type argv: :code:`list`
    :param input_file: File from which the command will read data.
    :type input_file: :code:`file`
    :param output_file: File to which the command will write data.
    :type output_file: :code:`file`
    :param module_name: Name of the module calling :code:`dispatch` or :const:`None`.
    :type module_name: :code:`str`
    :returns: :const:`None`

    **Example**

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        #!/usr/bin/env python
        from splunklib.searchcommands import dispatch, StreamingCommand, Configuration, Option, validators

            def stream(records):
                ...
        dispatch(SomeStreamingCommand, module_name=__name__)

    Dispatches the :code:`SomeStreamingCommand`, if and only if
    :code:`__name__` is equal to :code:`'__main__'`.
